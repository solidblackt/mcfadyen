# Theme Developement
1) Add theme inside - app\design\frontend
2) Activate theme from admin

Note:
1) Design does not match with 100% with Figma but added all functionality, files and required structure.
2) Regarding product gallery right now used default magento to manage parameter using XML. Second way we can remove fotorama library and we can add slick or other library in the responsive view.
